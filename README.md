## Project Overview

This project implements a Graph Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for molecule generation, inspired by the paper [Graph Variational Autoencoders for Molecule Generation](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13321-019-0396-x.pdf). The implementation leverages the PyTorch Geometric library to enhance the efficiency of graph-based operations.

## Key Contributions and Achievements

1. **Graph-Based Representation:** Developed a robust graph-based representation of molecular structures, encoding atom and bond information into a format suitable for training a Variational Autoencoder.

2. **Variational Autoencoder Architecture:** Implemented the Variational Autoencoder architecture tailored for molecular graphs, incorporating both encoder and decoder components. This allowed for the generation of novel molecular structures.

3. **PyTorch Geometric Integration:** Leveraged PyTorch Geometric to streamline graph operations, enhancing the scalability and computational efficiency of the model. This integration facilitated seamless manipulation of graph data within the PyTorch framework.

4. **Probabilistic Latent Space:** Utilized the VAE's probabilistic latent space to generate diverse and meaningful molecular structures. This ensured that the model could produce a variety of valid molecules while maintaining chemical feasibility.

5. **Performance Evaluation:** Conducted thorough performance evaluation using established metrics, assessing the model's ability to generate molecules with desirable properties. This included metrics such as diversity, novelty, and adherence to chemical constraints.
